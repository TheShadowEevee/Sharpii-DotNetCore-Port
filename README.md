# Sharpii - A command line libWiiSharp tool

# Fork Notes
- Status: Local work in progress, no change on repo yet
- Purpose: A .Net Core port of Sharpii for use on Mac and Linux, intended for use with my Unix rewrite of the RC24 Patcher [Put Link Here], but it can be used for any purpose when it's done.
- Issues/Pull Requests: All issues with this version of Sharpii should go in this fork's issue tracker. The issue is likely with the port and even if it isn't maybe I can fix it as I don't know if the original Sharpii creator is still active here. Pull requests are appreciated if they fix an issue, but it may take a bit to review.

# Repo info
Sharpii is a command line app for windows that I (person66) made, which uses leathl's libWiiSharp.dll (as of version 1.2 it acutally uses scooby74029's mod of libWiiSharp) to perform tasks such as:
- Pack, unpack, or edit .wad files
- Pack, and unpack U8 archives
- Patch IOS .wad files with various patches
- Download files from NUS
- Convert a .wav file to .bns, and vice versa
- Convert an image file to a .tpl, and vice versa
- Send a .dol or .wad to the Homebrew Channel over Wi-Fi
