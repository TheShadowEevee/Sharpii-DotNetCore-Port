# Sharpii .Net Core Port - A command line libWiiSharp tool ported for all OS's.

## Repo info
Sharpii is a command line app for windows that person66 made and was ported to .Net Core by TheShadowEevee, which uses scooby74029's mod of libWiiSharp to perform tasks such as:
- Pack, unpack, or edit .wad files
- Pack, and unpack U8 archives
- Patch IOS .wad files with various patches
- Download files from NUS
- Convert a .wav file to .bns, and vice versa
- Convert an image file to a .tpl, and vice versa
- Send a .dol or .wad to the Homebrew Channel over Wi-Fi

For more details see the readme.txt in the sharpii folder or visit the official Sharpii thread at: http://gbatemp.net/topic/309756-sharpii/

## Download
You can download the latest version of Sharpii on the project's releases page: https://github.com/TheShadowEevee/Sharpii-NetCore/releases/
Certain releases will have certain executables pre-made. If an executable you need isn't there, compile it yourself! I will have instructions soon. You may also open an issue for this but it may be denyed.

## Issues/Pull Requests
All issues with this version of Sharpii should go in this fork's issue tracker. The issue is likely with the port, and even if it isn't maybe I can fix it as I don't know if the original Sharpii creator is still active. Pull requests are appreciated if they fix an issue, but it may take a bit to review.


## Giving Credit
No credit is needed to use this program! If you do give credit, make sure to put the original creator(s) names first! (person66 for Sharpii, and scooby74029 for the libWiiSharp.dll used)
