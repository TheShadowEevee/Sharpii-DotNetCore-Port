# Sharpii - A command line libWiiSharp tool

# Fork Notes
- Status: Ported and working! Mac untested. If you try, make a pull request to change this readme!

- Purpose: A .Net Core port of Sharpii for use on Mac and Linux, intended for use with my Unix rewrite of the RC24 Patcher but it can be used for any purpose.

- Issues/Pull Requests: All issues with this version of Sharpii should go in this fork's issue tracker. The issue is likely with the port, and even if it isn't maybe I can fix it as I don't know if the original Sharpii creator is still active. Pull requests are appreciated if they fix an issue, but it may take a bit to review.

- Giving Credit: No credit is needed to use this program! If you do give credit, make sure to put the original creator(s) names first! [person66, and possibly leathl and/or scooby74029]

# Repo info
Sharpii is a command line app for windows that person66 made, which uses leathl's libWiiSharp.dll (as of version 1.2 it acutally uses scooby74029's mod of libWiiSharp) to perform tasks such as:
- Pack, unpack, or edit .wad files
- Pack, and unpack U8 archives
- Patch IOS .wad files with various patches
- Download files from NUS
- Convert a .wav file to .bns, and vice versa
- Convert an image file to a .tpl, and vice versa
- Send a .dol or .wad to the Homebrew Channel over Wi-Fi
